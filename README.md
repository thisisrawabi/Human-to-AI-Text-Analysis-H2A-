# üß† Human-to-AI Text Analysis (H2A)

## üìå Overview
This project analyzes and compares text written by **Humans (0)** and **AI (1)**.  
The workflow extracts linguistic features, normalizes them, and visualizes the differences between human and AI writing styles.

Key outputs include:  
- **Radar plots** showing normalized style fingerprints.  
- **Delta bar charts** highlighting which features are higher in AI vs Human.  
- **Summary tables** with mean values and differences.
